## Welcome!

### About me
Hello everybody! My name is Guillermo; nice to meet you. I was born in Spain and got a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Seville. I’m currently working at Acronis as a Senior Software Developer.

Some of my hobbies are music, which I’m passionate about, history and other fields in engineering (in fact, any area of science will do for me). I also like reading Wikipedia as much as possible, sports (callisthenics especially), languages or video games.

I’m naturally a curious person and everything can draw my attention. I always want to understand the fundamentals of something before getting to more intricate details, which has helped me many times throughout my life, as well as it has brough up many questions that I don't think I'll be able ever to answer.

Fun facts about me: I learned the [Doomsday rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule) and still practice it almost daily. I also like to learn Spanish sayings, which I find lovely, as I do with Spanish. Last but not least, I practice typing every day, and I am one of the top 100 fastest Spanish typers on 10fastfingers, where I’m known as GuilleX7 (a nick I like to use). My record is to write 167 wpm (words per minute) in a 60-second test, but I’m on my way to beating it.

### About my career
Since I started coding at an early age, I’ve developed many projects, some of which I don’t even have the source code for. I remember my first program was a calculator in a batch file for Windows XP, probably around 7. I was fascinated by how I could automate that thing and make it work; it was like magic.

It’s been a long time, but I still feel the same. I’ve learned much about Computer Engineering in the past years, especially how we must build software. I use that knowledge to build reliable, well-designed software. I feel particularly motivated when the goal is to help others. I hope to keep this feeling for many, many more years.

I'm particularly interested in operating systems, computer architecture and theory of algorithms and data structures, as well as languages and automata theory. I've taken part in many competitive programming contests, such as [AdaByron](https://ada-byron.es/2023/), where I made it to the contest's national phase together with a group of friends. Such an amazing experience :)
